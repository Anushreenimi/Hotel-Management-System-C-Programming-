## Overview
The Hotel Management System is a simple, console-based application developed in C. It is designed to handle basic hotel operations such as adding and viewing customer information. This project highlights key C programming concepts such as modular programming with separate source and header files, the use of structures (struct) for organizing customer data, and functions to keep the code clean and reusable. It also features a menu-driven interface, making the system simple to use and easy to expand with additional functionality in the future.
## Project Structure
The project is divided into three files to showcase the concept of modular programming in C:
1. **main.c**-The entry point of the program. It contains the menu and handles user interaction.
2. **customer.c**-Contains the implementation of customer-related functions such as adding and viewing customers.
3. **customer.h**-The header file that defines the structure of a customer and declares function prototypes for use across files.
